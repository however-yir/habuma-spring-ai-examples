JBang + Spring AI MCP Examples
===

The code in this folder demonstrate how to use [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/)
with [Spring AI](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai) to create MCP servers
and clients.

There are two MCP servers, one each for the STDIO transport and the HTTP
Streaming transport. And there are corresponding clients for each server.

To use these scripts, you'll need to first make sure that JBang is installed.
And if you will be using the clients, you'll need to have
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and will need to have pulled the
GPT-OSS model.

STDIO
---
When using the STDIO transport, the client is responsible for starting the
server in a process. The communication between client and server takes place
over standard input/output (STDIO).

One such client is the script in `McpClientStdio.java`. To run it using
JBang:

```shell
jbang McpClientStdio.java
```

When the client starts up, it will also start the server defined in
`McpServerStdio.java`. It will submit a prompt to the GPT-OSS model in Ollama
asking about the weather in Denver. After consulting with the "get-weather"
tool provided by the MCP Server, it should report that it is rainy and 79F.

Alternatively, you can configure any other MCP client, including
[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/), the
[MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and
[MCP Jam](https://www.mcpjam.com/). to work with the server defined in
`McpServerStdio.java` by specifing `jbang` as the command and the path to
`McpServerStdio.java` as the arguments. Expressed in Claude Desktop
configuration, it looks like this:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "jbang-weather": {
    "command": "/Users/habuma/.sdkman/candidates/jbang/current/bin/jbang",
    "args": [
      "/Users/habuma/Projects/spring-ai-examples/jbang-mcp/McpServerStdio.java"
    ]
  }
},
```

Or, as one more example, to configure this MCP server for use in Claude Code,
use the following command:

```shell
claude mcp add jbang-weather -- /path/to/jbang /path/to/McpServerStdio.java
```

Then, in your client of choice, ask about the weather in any city.

Streamable HTTP
---
For the Streamable HTTP transport, the server and client are run separately.

First, start the server:

```shell
jbang McpServerStreamableHttp.java
```

This should start the server, listening port 3001. The URI for the server is
http://localhost:3001/mcp.

In a separate terminal window, run the client:

```shell
jbang McpClientStreamableHttp.java
```

If everything goes well, after a short while you should be shown the weather
conditions in Denver: Rainy and 79F.

Of course, you can also use this MCP server using any client that supports the
Streamable HTTP transport, including [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/),
the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) and
[MCP Jam](https://www.mcpjam.com/).

Unfortunately, Claude Code does not support Streamable HTTP, but you can use a
proxy if you have `npx` installed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jbang-weather": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:3001/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For one more example, here's how you would add the server in Claude Code:

```shell
claude mcp add --transport http jbang-weather http://localhost:3001/mcp
```
