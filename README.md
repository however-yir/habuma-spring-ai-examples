# Spring AI Examples

This repository is where I'll commit various examples of using Spring AI.

You can clone this project in its entirety and work with it like that. *Or*
better, use the [SpringCLI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cli/reference/index.html)
to select individual projects and create them locally.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17+
- Maven / Gradle (or use each sub-project's wrapper)
- Optional model provider key (for example DashScope/OpenAI compatible endpoint)

## Run a Single Example

Most examples are independent sub-projects. For example:

```bash
cd spring-ai-rag-chat
./mvnw test
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Run All Example Tests

From repository root:

```bash
chmod +x build-all.sh
./build-all.sh
```

## Configuration Notes

- Put sensitive keys in environment variables, do not hardcode them in source files.
- Prefer creating local profile files (for example `application-local.yml`) and keep them out of git.

Action](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-ai-in-action?a_aid=habuma&a_bid=f205d999&chan=habuma),
now available at Manning.com, Amazon, and anywhere you buy tech books. It covers all aspects of
working with Spring AI with a fun example that runs throughout most of the book.
